    - Natural language enhancement: `"tomorrow morning"` → `"tomorrow 9am"`, `"yesterday evening"` → `"yesterday 6pm"`
    - Complex expression normalization: `"day after tomorrow"` → `"+2 days"`, `"day before yesterday"` → `"-2 days"`
    - Time format normalization: Handles `"@"`, `"at"`, and various am/pm formats
  - **Enhanced Pattern Matching**: Consolidated regex patterns with improved flexibility
    - Relative days with time: `"+3 days 2pm"`, `"-2 days 9:30am"`
    - Relative weeks with time: `"+2 weeks 1pm"`, `"-1 weeks 5pm"`
    - Enhanced yesterday/tomorrow: `"tomorrow 8am"`, `"yesterday 7:30pm"`
  - **Expanded Format Support**: Added support for multiple new date formats
    - US dates with time: `"7/4/2025 5pm"`, `"11/11/2030 11:11pm"`
    - Text month formats: `"march 10 2025 6:30pm"`
    - Dates without year: `"10/10 6:00pm"` (assumes current year)
    - Timestamp boundary fix: Now accepts Year 2000 boundary (`946684800000`)
  - **Improved Date Clearing**: Fixed date clearing functionality to properly set `null` values

  - **Comprehensive Testing**: Achieves 100% success rate on 50-test comprehensive suite
  - **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved while adding significant new capabilities

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Fixed Task Assignment Functionality**:
  - **Root Cause**: ClickUp API uses different formats for assignees in task creation vs updates
    - Creation: `"assignees": [user_id1, user_id2]` (simple array)
    - Updates: `"assignees": { "add": [user_id1], "rem": [user_id2] }` (object with add/rem arrays)
  - **Parameter Parsing**: Fixed MCP serialization issue where assignee arrays were received as strings
  - **Smart Assignment Logic**: Implemented intelligent add/remove calculation by comparing current vs desired assignees
  - **Complete Functionality**: Now supports adding, removing, and updating task assignees
  - **Multiple Formats**: Supports user IDs, emails, and usernames for assignee resolution
  - **TypeScript Types**: Updated interfaces to support both array and object assignee formats
  - **Testing**: Verified full assignment cycle (add → remove → re-add) works correctly

- **Fixed Track Time tool response formatting issue**:
  - Fixed issue where Track Time tools (start/stop time tracking, get time entries, etc.) were executing successfully but returning no output to users
  - **Root cause**: Time tracking handlers were returning raw JavaScript objects instead of using proper MCP server response formatting
  - **Solution**: Updated all 6 time tracking handlers to use `sponsorService.createResponse()` method for consistent response formatting
  - **Handlers fixed**: `handleStartTimeTracking`, `handleStopTimeTracking`, `handleGetTaskTimeEntries`, `handleAddTimeEntry`, `handleDeleteTimeEntry`, `handleGetCurrentTimeEntry`
  - **Enhanced error handling**: All error responses now use `sponsorService.createErrorResponse()` for consistent error formatting
  - **Added null safety**: Fixed potential undefined property access in time entries data with proper null checks
  - **Improved user experience**: Added helpful success messages and proper data structure formatting
  - **Impact**: Track Time tools now provide clear, formatted JSON responses instead of appearing to run silently

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Fixed priority null handling in task updates (Issue #23)**:
  - Fixed `update_task` tool failing when setting priority to `null` to clear/remove priority
  - Modified `buildUpdateData` function to use `toTaskPriority` helper for proper null value conversion
  - Priority updates now work correctly for both setting valid values (1-4) and clearing priority (null)
  - Bulk task updates (`update_bulk_tasks`) already worked correctly and continue to function properly

- **Fixed subtasks not being retrieved (Issue #69)**:
  - Fixed `getSubtasks` method in `task-core.ts` to include required query parameters
  - Added `subtasks=true` and `include_subtasks=true` parameters to ClickUp API call

## v0.8.3 (2025-07-03)

### 🚀 New Features & Improvements

- **Enhanced workspace tasks filtering with Views API support (Issue #43)**:
  - **Enhanced list filtering**: When `list_ids` are provided, `get_workspace_tasks` now uses ClickUp's Views API for comprehensive task coverage
  - **Multi-list task support**: Now retrieves tasks that are *associated with* specified lists, including tasks created elsewhere and added to multiple lists
  - **Two-tier filtering strategy**:
    - **Server-side filtering**: Supported filters applied at ClickUp API level for efficiency (statuses, assignees, dates, etc.)
    - **Client-side filtering**: Additional filters applied after data retrieval (tags, folder_ids, space_ids)
  - **API endpoints used**:
    - `GET /list/{listId}/view` - Retrieves list views and identifies default list view
    - `GET /view/{viewId}/task` - Retrieves all tasks associated with the view/list
  - **Performance optimizations**:
    - Concurrent API calls for multiple lists using `Promise.all()`
    - Task deduplication to prevent duplicate results
    - Automatic summary format switching for large result sets
    - Safety limits to prevent infinite pagination loops
  - **Robust error handling**: Graceful degradation when some lists fail, comprehensive logging
  - **Backward compatibility**: Existing functionality unchanged when `list_ids` not provided
  - **Impact**: Addresses ClickUp's "tasks in multiple lists" feature, providing complete task coverage for list-based queries

    Thanks @dantearaujo for the help!

- **Added ENABLED_TOOLS configuration option (PR #39 & Issue #50)**:
  - Added `ENABLED_TOOLS` environment variable and command line argument support
  - Allows specifying exactly which tools should be available via comma-separated list
  - Provides complementary functionality to existing `DISABLED_TOOLS` option
  - **Precedence logic**: `ENABLED_TOOLS` takes precedence over `DISABLED_TOOLS` when both are specified
  - **Configuration options**:
    - `ENABLED_TOOLS=tool1,tool2` - Only enable specified tools
    - `DISABLED_TOOLS=tool1,tool2` - Disable specified tools (legacy approach)
    - If neither specified, all tools are available (default behavior)
  - **Enhanced tool filtering**:
    - Updated `ListToolsRequestSchema` handler to use new filtering logic
    - Updated `CallToolRequestSchema` handler with improved error messages
    - Clear distinction between "disabled" vs "not in enabled tools list" errors
  - **Impact**: Users can now precisely control tool availability for security, context limitations, or workflow optimization
  - **Backward compatibility**: Existing `DISABLED_TOOLS` functionality unchanged

  Thanks @somework & @colinmollenhour for the help!

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

- **Fixed automatic priority assignment in task creation**:
  - Fixed issue where `create_task` and `create_bulk_tasks` tools were automatically setting priorities even when users didn't specify one
  - **Root cause**: Priority field was unconditionally included in API requests as `undefined`, which ClickUp interpreted as a request to set a default priority
  - **Solution**: Priority field is now only included in API requests when explicitly provided by the user
  - **Impact**: Tasks created without specifying a priority will now have `priority: null` instead of an automatically assigned priority
  - **Affected tools**: `create_task_ClickUp__Local_` and `create_bulk_tasks_ClickUp__Local_`
  - **Backward compatibility**: Tasks created with explicit priority values continue to work unchanged

## v0.8.2 (2025-06-12)

### 🚀 New Features & Improvements

### �🛠️ Bug Fixes

- **Fixed task assignment feature not working (Issue #48)**:
  - Fixed critical bug where task assignees were not being properly assigned despite successful API responses
  - Root cause: Missing assignee resolution logic in task creation and update handlers
  - Added comprehensive assignee resolution supporting multiple input formats:
    - Numeric user IDs (e.g., `96055451`)
    - Email addresses (e.g., `"user@example.com"`)
    - Usernames (e.g., `"John Doe"`)
    - Mixed format arrays (e.g., `[96055451, "user@example.com"]`)
  - Enhanced task handlers with automatic assignee resolution:
    - `create_task` - Now resolves assignees before task creation
    - `update_task` - Now resolves assignees during task updates
    - `create_bulk_tasks` - Now resolves assignees for each task in bulk operations
  - Added proper deduplication for duplicate assignees in mixed format requests
  - Added graceful error handling for unresolvable assignees (continues with resolved ones)
  - **Impact**: Task assignment now works correctly for all documented assignee formats
  - **Supported formats**: User IDs, email addresses, usernames, and mixed arrays

- **Fixed task due date updates not working (Issue #49)**:
  - Fixed critical bug where `update_task` returned success but didn't actually update due dates
  - Root cause: `updateTaskHandler` was not calling `buildUpdateData()` to parse date strings into timestamps
  - Enhanced natural language date parsing to support complex formats:
    - Added support for day names: "Monday", "Friday", "Saturday", etc.
    - Added time parsing: "Monday at 3pm EST", "Friday at 2:30pm", etc.
    - Added "next" prefix handling: "next Friday", "next Monday", etc.
    - Improved fallback parsing with multiple strategies and validation
  - **Impact**: Due date updates now work correctly for all supported date formats
  - **Supported formats**: "tomorrow", "Monday at 3pm EST", "next Friday", Unix timestamps, "MM/DD/YYYY", relative times like "2 hours from now"

- **Fixed subtask visibility in workspace tasks (Issue #56)**:
  - Added missing `subtasks` parameter to `get_workspace_tasks` tool
  - Added missing `include_subtasks`, `include_compact_time_entries`, and `custom_fields` parameters for completeness
  - Updated tool description to clarify how subtasks parameter works with filtering
  - **Impact**: Users can now access subtasks through workspace-wide queries when subtasks match filter criteria
  - **Note**: Subtasks must still match other filter criteria (tags, lists, etc.) to appear in results
  - **Alternative**: Use `get_task` tool with `subtasks=true` to see all subtasks of a specific task regardless of filters

### 🛠️ Critical Bug Fixes

- **Fixed JSON Schema Validation Error**:
  - Resolved server startup failure with error: `Invalid schema for tool list_document_pages: strict mode: unknown keyword: "optional"`
  - Removed invalid `optional: true` keywords from document tool schemas
  - Fixed schemas for: `list_document_pages`, `get_document_pages`, `create_document_page`, `update_document_page`
  - **Technical Note**: In JSON Schema, optional properties are defined by omitting them from the `required` array, not by using an `optional` keyword
